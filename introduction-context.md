# Introduction and Context

## Problem Statement

Agriculture in Algeria faces mounting challenges as traditional farming methods struggle to meet modern demands for efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability. The vineyard sector, particularly table grape cultivation, represents a critical component of Algeria's agricultural economy, yet it remains vulnerable to diseases, pests, and inefficient treatment practices.

### Current Challenges in Algerian Viticulture

**Disease and Pest Pressure:**
- Fungal diseases affecting 30-40% of annual grape production
- Increasing pest resistance to conventional treatments
- Climate change intensifying disease pressure and unpredictability

**Economic Constraints:**
- Rising costs of chemical treatments and labor
- Inefficient uniform application leading to resource waste
- Limited access to modern agricultural technology
- Small-scale farming operations with restricted budgets

**Environmental Concerns:**
- Soil degradation from excessive chemical use
- Groundwater contamination affecting local communities
- Loss of beneficial insects and biodiversity
- Regulatory pressure for sustainable farming practices
