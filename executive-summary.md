# Executive Summary
Sustainable Automation of Phytosanitary Treatments for Vineyards
## Project Overview

this project project presents an AI/iot solution specifically designed for table grape cultivation in Boumerdes.
This research combines AI, IoT, Mechatronics, and Environmental engineering tring to fix critical challenges facing local vineyard farmers.

**Target Region:** Boumerdes
**Primary Crop:** Table grapes  
**Technologies:** AI + IoT + Mechatronics + Environmental Engineering

## Problem Statement

Table grape cultivation in Boumerdes faces significant threats from fungal diseases and pests, with current protection methods creating multiple challenges:

- **Economic Burden:** Uniform chemical treatments increase costs by 40-60% due to inefficient resource allocation
- **Environmental Impact:** Excessive chemical use pollutes soil, contaminates groundwater, and harms biodiversity
- **Operational Challenges:** Declining agricultural labor and inability to target specific affected areas

## Proposed Solution Architecture
basic setup requires at list single RGB or IR camera, GPS.
other components like weather sensors, microscopic cameras, and drones are optional but enhance the system's capabilities.
